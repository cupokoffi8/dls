# DLS  

DLS is the acronym for the Discord server I share with my closest friends. While the meaning behind it holds personal significance, it wouldn't make much sense to anyone outside our group, so I'll leave it mysterious.  

## About the Project  

This project started as a fun hobby inspired by the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence. My goal is to bring two uniquely trained AI models into our Discord server as chatbots, each with their own distinct personalities and sense of humor. By providing proper context and creative prompts, these chatbots can engage in entertaining, context-aware interactions that enhance the overall experience of the server.  

This project is powered by open-source AI models, generously shared by the amazing contributors at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/).  

## Features  

- **Multiple AI Chatbots**: Two distinct AI personalities trained on diverse datasets.  
- **Contextual Conversations**: Chatbots adapt their responses based on the context provided.  
- **Humor and Personality**: Designed to make interactions fun and engaging.  
- **Discord Integration**: Seamlessly integrated with a Discord server for real-time interaction.
